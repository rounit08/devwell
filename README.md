## Overview

The DevWell Chrome Extension is a productivity tool designed to help developers maintain a healthy work routine. It utilizes JavaScript and the Chrome API to monitor the background time spent on open tabs and prompts users with exercise and water reminders every 90 minutes. These reminders aim to keep you physically active and hydrated during long coding sessions, promoting your overall well-being and productivity.

## Features

1. **Regular Exercise Reminders**: The extension periodically presents a popup notification containing an exercise suggestion and an accompanying GIF to demonstrate the exercise.

2. **Hydration Reminders**: Alongside exercise reminders, the extension also prompts users to drink water at regular intervals, helping them stay hydrated throughout the day.
